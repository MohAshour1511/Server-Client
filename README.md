A client-server application that demonstrates my skills in network programming. The project involved:
- Developing a server that listens on a specific port and accepts incoming connections.
- Creating a client that connects to the server using an IP address and port number.
- Ensuring smooth and reliable communication between the client and server, even when multiple clients are connected.
